This is my personal blog/journal, I'll be keeping notes of my exploits with FreeBSD, macOS, Mac OS X and sometimes even some coding frolics. Though, they won't be advanced or particularly enlightening.

The layout will probably change randomly as I play around with different ideas. It's a work in progress and a bit of a testing ground.
