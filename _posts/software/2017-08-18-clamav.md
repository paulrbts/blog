#### What's going down
[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) is anti-virus software developed by Cisco.
It runs on macOS, the BSDs, Linux, Windows etc.

Even though you're obviously exercising caution in your daily computing, sometimes it's worth scanning for software to see if you've picked up any malware, even if it hasn't been able to affect you.

All of the ClamAV setup can be found in the [manual](https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-faq/raw/master/manual/clamdoc.pdf).

Throughout, the macOS directory `Users` can be substituted by `home` on BSD or Linux.

##### Manual
To view the manual at any time, just `man clamscan` or use the link above.

##### Install
Installation is easier with [Homebrew](https://www.brew.sh).

	$ brew install clamav

##### Create and edit configuration files

	$ cd /usr/local/etc/clamav
	$ cp freshclam.conf.sample freshclam.conf
	$ vi freshclam.conf

Comment/Uncomment the following lines, so they look like this:
```sh
# Example
SubmitDetectionStats /var/logs/clamav
```
##### Update database

    $ freshclam

If the output is OK, create a log file in /var/log (owned by clamav or another user freshclam will be running as):

	$ touch /var/log/freshclam.log
	$ chmod 600 /var/log/freshclam.log
	$ chown clamav /var/log/freshclam.log

Then run the following to start the freshclam daemon:

	$ freshclam -d

However, we may find that we get the error:

	ERROR: Can't open /var/log/freshclam.log in append mode (check permissions!).
	ERROR: Problem with internal logger (UpdateLogFile = /var/log/freshclam.log).

In which case, we need to edit the following files and comment out the lines:
```sh
$ vi /usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
DatabaseOwner clamav

$ vi /usr/local/etc/clamav/clamd.conf
User clamav
```

This will run the daemon in the background -- until shutdown.
To make it persist, it's suggested to use `cron` and have it run 2+ times per hour.
This is fine for BSD and Linux environments but, seeing as `cron`'s deprecated in macOS, we ought to be using `launchd`.
To run under `cron`, you have to add the following to the `crontab` of either `root` or the user `clamav`, where 'N' is the minutes past the hour at which you want the task to run:

	N * * * * /usr/local/bin/freshclam --quiet

The `launchd` approach is to paste the following into a LaunchDaemon located at /Library/LaunchDaemons, named something like com.personal.freshclam.plist:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.personal.freshclam</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
	    <string>/usr/local/bin/freshclam</string>
		<string>-d</string>
	</array>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <false/>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StartInterval</key>
        <integer>1800</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
```

This will run every 30 minutes and check for updates to the database.

##### Scanning
Running a full system scan uses the familiar layout of `command flags target`, flags -r is recursive, --bell shows a Terminal bell when an infection is found and -i will only print the infected files.

	$ clamscan -r --bell -i /

The output will show you any infected files, with their locations.

Other options are available, such as the flag `--move=/Users/[username]/quarantine` which moves viruses to a specified location.

##### Dealing with infections
When an infection is found, the options depend on which flags you used previously.
ClamAV's `--remove` flag should remove any infections during the scan.
This can be dangerous (and even carries a warning in the manual) as it can/will remove files that an infection is part of.
It re-runs the scan and deals with the infections as it finds them.

	$ clamscan -r --remove /Users/[username]

Alternatively, if you used the `--move` flag then you could go straight to the specified folder and remove them manually.
Lastly, you can just read the locations from the output.

##### Automated daily scans
The next thing to do is make sure all this is automated so it runs in the background without input.
We'll write a script, courtesy of [centosblog](https://www.centosblog.com/how-to-install-clamav-and-configure-daily-scanning-on-centos/).

```sh
$ vi ~/scripts/ClamAV
    SCAN_DIR="/Users"
    LOG_FILE="/var/log/clamscan.log"
    echo `date +%F-%H%M` >> $LOG_FILE
    /usr/local/bin/clamscan -i -r --move=/Users/[username]/quarantine $SCAN_DIR >> $LOG_FILE
# on BSD/Linux the location might be /usr/bin, so instead:
    /usr/bin/clamscan -i -r --move=/home/[username]/quarantine $SCAN_DIR >> $LOG_FILE
```
The script needs to be executable:

	$ chmod u+x ~/scripts/ClamAV

Finally, since we told it to write a logfile in `/var/log` we need to make sure it can be written, so create the file and set the permissions on it to match the user who will be running the script:

	$ sudo touch /var/log/clamscan.log
	$ sudo chown [username]:[group] /var/log/clamscan.log

Now, for BSD/Linux we just need to install it to crontab and make sure it runs regularly:

	$ crontab -e
	05	*	*	*	*	~/scripts/ClamAV

Or, for macOS, it's back to launchd:

	$ sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.personal.clamav.plist

And paste:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.personal.clamscan</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/[you]/Scripts/clamscan</string>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <false/>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>18</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>28</integer>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/clamscan.stderr</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Finally, let's just make sure we get system emails telling us if there's anything found.
First, we write a simple script named `clam-mail` located at ~/Scripts:

```sh
echo "There are new items for review in /Users/[you]/tmp/quarantine" | mail -s "URGENT! Clamscan Found Infections!" root
```

This will send an email to `root` using the [`postfix` setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/2017/08/12/postfix-macos-gmx/) process that we've already been through.
Then we create the LaunchDaemon:

	$ sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.personal.clammail.plist

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.personal.clammail</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/Users/[you]/Scripts/clam-mail</string>
	</array>
    <key>WatchPaths</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/[you]/tmp/quarantine</string>
    </array>
    <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>
    <true/>
	<key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/clamscanqmail.stderr</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
