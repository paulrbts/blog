<h2>Wilkommen</h2>

<p>This is my personal blog where I'll be talking about modifications and hacks I discover. It'll probably be:
  <ul>
    <li>FreeBSD</li>
    <li>macOS/OS X</li>
    <li>LaTeX</li>
    <li>R</li>
  </ul>
Other things may come along, just depends how I'm feeling and what I'm exploring at any given time.
And whether or not I can be bothered, or feel the need, to write about.
I don't intend to overtly proselytise about my methods <i>etc.</i>, rather to document and share some of my findings, mainly so I can be sure I understand them by re-iterating them.</p>
